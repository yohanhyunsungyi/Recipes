#### View
- `HomeView`: Main view with search, filtering, and grid layout
- `DetailView`: Detailed recipe view with sharing options
- `RecipeCard`: Reusable card component
- `RecipeImage`: Async image loading with placeholder support

#### ViewModel
- `RecipeViewModel`: Handles business logic, state management, and user interactions

#### Utiliteis
- `ImageLoader`: Combines local and remote image loading
- `LocalImageLoader`: Interface for local image caching operations
- `RemoteImageLoader`: Handles network image fetching
- `ImageCache`: Thread-safe memory caching using `NSCache`
- `RecipeLoader`: Manages recipe data fetching

## 2. Focus Areas

**Image Management System**: ImageLoader orchestrates the loading process by coordinating between local cache and remote fetching.
1. Check memory cache via `LocalImageLoader`
2. If cache miss, fetch from network via `RemoteImageLoader`
3. Store successful network loads in memory cache
4. Publish results to SwiftUI view
   
## 3. Trade-offs and Decisions

**Filtered Recipe Array in View**: The filtered recipe array is stored in the view layer rather than the ViewModel. This decision was made to:
  - Maintain better separation of concerns where the ViewModel manages the source of truth (original recipes)
  - Allow for more flexible and independent filtering logic
  - Reduce unnecessary state synchronization between the ViewModel and views

## 4. Weakest Part of the Project

#### Task Management and Race Conditions
- Current task management in the project needs more detailed implementation, especially regarding cancellation
- With multiple features and concurrent operations, there's a potential risk of race conditions
- Future improvements should include more robust task lifecycle management and better synchronization mechanisms

#### Memory Management
- The current image caching system needs improvements for scalability
- Although the API currently returns a manageable number of images, the system could face memory pressure with a larger dataset
